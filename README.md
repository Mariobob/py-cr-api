# Introduction
What is it all about?
This is a https://cr-api.com a simple wrapper for educational purposea i decided to step up and learn more advanced things.

# WARNING!
This wrapper is using requests(Blocking) not async so if you do multiple stuff it can slow down while making requests
# installatiin
I guess you can install it with the pip + git to help me test it
`pip install -U git+https://github.com/freetnt5852/py-cr-api.py`
# contributing
